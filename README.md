### Hi, I am Fatih!

I am a Certified SolidWorks Expert (<a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/714364cf-6316-4259-a887-f85d9bb7d731/public_url" target="_blank">CSWE</a>). For the last years I have been working as an aircraft maintenance planner.

I want to improve my programming skills, that's why I created a <a href="https://github.com/fatihmeh" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and a <a href="https://gitlab.com/users/fatihmehmetozcan/projects" target="_blank">GitLab</a> profile.

Check out my repositories and website for more information. See you later 🐊
