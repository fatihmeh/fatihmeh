### Hi, I am Fatih!

I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design" target="_blank" title="CAD">computer-aided design</a> user/operator/specialist/programmer with experience more than 10 years. I am a Certified SolidWorks Expert as in short <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/714364cf-6316-4259-a887-f85d9bb7d731/public_url" target="_blank">CSWE</a>. For the last years I have been working as an aircraft maintenance planner.

I want to improve my programming skills, that's why I created a <a href="https://github.com/fatihmeh" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and a <a href="https://gitlab.com/users/fatihmehmetozcan/projects" target="_blank">GitLab</a> profile. Until now, I used SolidWorks, Catia, Autocad and Excel APIs and created multiple <a href="https://gitlab.com/fatihmehmetozcan/Arbitrary-Macros-for-CAD" target="_blank">macros</a>, also published <a href="https://fatihmeh.github.io/" target="_blank">my personal site</a>.

Check out my repositories and website for more information. Hope to see you later.
