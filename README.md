### Hi, I am Fatih!

I am a computer-aided design ([CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design "CTRL + click to open in a new tab")) expert. I had worked as an aircraft maintenance planner. And recently I design modifications for commercial and VIP aircraft.

I want to improve my programming skills, that's why I created a [GitHub](https://github.com/fatihmeh "CTRL + click to open in a new tab") and a [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/fatihmehmetozcan/projects "CTRL + Click to open in a new tab") profile.

Check out my [website](https://www.fatihozcan.dev "CTRL + click to open in a new tab") for more information. See you later üêä
