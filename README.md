### Hi, I am Fatih!

I am a computer-aided design (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design" target="_blank">CAD</a>) specialist. For the last years I have been working as an aircraft maintenance planner.

I want to improve my programming skills, that's why I created a <a href="https://github.com/fatihmeh" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and a <a href="https://gitlab.com/users/fatihmehmetozcan/projects" target="_blank">GitLab (most repos are there)</a> profile.

Check out my <a href="https://fatihmeh.github.io" target="_blank">website</a> for more information. See you later 🐊
